      <h2>Gravity</h2>
      <p>
        Gravity is an attempt to simulate the gravitational attraction of
        multiple object on each other.  It's (somewhat loosely) based on
        Newton's equations.  I'm no Astrophysicist but if you take true genius,
        squash the Universe into a 2 dimensional plane, toss out
        the stuff that is hard to understand and fiddle with the remainder
        until it looks about right, then you end up with something like this.

        There was an old Windows 95 screen saver that inspired me to write this.
        I tried to find it but I think it was shareware and I don't have anything
        to run it on anyway.  My result isn't an exact copy.  The original drew
        rocks, planets and stars, but I found it more interesting just to use
        colors to indicate each mass.
